What are your academic interests?
I dont have any. 
    The one defining characteristic that makes anything enjoyable is whether it is meaningful. I feel like any kind of work can be enjoyable so long as you
find meaning in said work. For example, most people would find working at Mcdonalds dull and soul crushing, but would those same people find cooking for
their children, their spouse, their families to also be a similar experience?

I dont know how true this is but I sometimes see videos on youtube or posts on programming subreddits where people elaborate on their imposter syndrome.
I would imagine that many people feel this way when they first start a new job, regardless of occupation.

    The Department of Math, Engineering, 
and Computer science lists Computer Technology, Network admin and information security, and programming and software development as related degrees offered
here at Laguardia. The reason why I chose Computer Science was due to taking Harvards introductory course on Computer Science at edx.org. The professor who
taught the course(He still teaches the course, but he used to back then too) was a guy called David Malan. He was very enthusiastic and very knowledgeable 
about the subject and I enjoyed taking the course so much that I decided to look into how to become a programmer which eventually lead to my enrollment
for computer science in York and later Laguardia. Network Administration seems to involve setting up computer networks and how to keep them safe. Laguardia
describes the Computer Technology major as teaching students to "Understand computer system architecture and to work in areas where computer electronics are
deployed, controlled, and maintained". While I enjoyed the process of building my own computers I dont think I would find the doing it for a living to be 
enjoyable. The other program, Programming and Software Development AAS, is similar to computer science. It looks to have more classes where you can practice
coding as opposed to Computer Science which has more math classes which(I am guessing) would help you understand the theory behind concepts used in 
algorithms and data structures. 

    Do I know enough about this major? I would say no because, realistically, no amount of research could paint an accurate enough picture to definitely 
tell me whether I would enjoy or dislike a career in this field. Even getting a job as a programmer wouldnt be definitive because working at one company 
could be wildly different than working at another, or even working for the goverment. The only realistic method would be to do the job myself and judge
for myself whether the work is enjoyable, and if not enjoyable then at least judge whether I could tolerate it for the money. The requirements for the 
degree seem to be 4 programming classes and just as many math classes. The careers available to this major are many, but mostly stem with designing and 
implementing computer software. From what I remember, one of the many skills needed as a software developer is the ability to identify problems and to solve
them with as little help as possible. It is one thing to be asked a specific question and expected to solve it, and another to be given a task which might 
involve a lot of research before you can properly understand the scope of the problem, let alone solve it. As one user on /r/ExperiencedDevs puts it, "A 
junior developer typically requires specific, concrete implementation instructions. Create a new endpoint with this name, it should accept these 
parameters with these types, and the response should look like this. And here are the error conditions to watch out for." A slightly more experienced 
developer is expected to "be able to take a high-level description of a solution and implement it, knowing when to ask for clarifications and what to 
watch out for. Expose a new endpoint on top of this object turns into an end point with a sensible name, good error handling, and the correct parameters, 
with the developer asking questions when they need to (what type should this parameter be?)" A senior developer should be able to "take a problem and come
up with a solution that can then be broken down into implementation tasks. They should also be able to present multiple solutions and explain why we might
choose one or the other (where applicable). They should be able to start working with non-technical people to clarify things and be able to turn technical
questions into questions that non-technical people can understand. We need to expose this data to external consumers turns into we can either create an
API or a data feed, heres why we would do one vs. the other. Also, you said that this field should be a number, I just want to clarify if it's always going
to be a whole number or if decimals make sense from a business perspective? (a more junior developer might ask a non-technical user if the field should be 
an int or float and that conversation won't go anywhere)." Another reddit user succintly describes the difference between developers as juniors needing 
help, mid-levels as being independent, and seniors as providing help. 

    The skills that I will learn that I think will be most helpful are the ability to network and to identify where to look for jobs and how to tailor my 
(non-existent *cough*) skill set for any prospective employer. I dont know how true this is, but I remember hearing that any particular skill set isnt 
important in the grand scheme of things because of how quickly new technologies emerge. Rather, what is important is the ability to adapt to an ever
changing and fluid environment. Im too lazy(PepeLaugh) so here is a link to googles average compesation by levels 
https://www.levels.fyi/companies/google/salaries/software-engineer?country=254. Where would I see myself in 5 years? Idk(KEKW). Hopefully I would be doing 
something that I enjoy like swimming or playing video games, or reading books, or working out, etc.
